## Sets

A set is a collection of objects, which are the elements of the set

### element relation

#### in

$x \in S$: $S$ is a set and  $x$ is an element of $S$​

#### not in

$x \notin S$: $x$ is not an element of  $S$​

#### empty set

$\emptyset$: A set that has no element --> empty set

### set relation

#### subset

 $S\subseteq T$

#### equal set

 $S = T$

#### universal set

 $\Omega$ : a set that holds all the element in the sample

#### complement

 $\bar{S} = S^c = \Omega - S$

### set operation

#### union of sets

 $S \cup T$ 

#### intersection of sets

 $S \cap T \ \  \cap^{\infty}_{i = 1}S_i \ \ \ \cap_{i\in I}S_i$ 

#### De Morgan's laws

 $\bar{U_iS_i}$ =  $\cap_i\bar{S_i}$ ,  $\bar{\cap_iS_i} = \cup_i\bar{S_i}$
