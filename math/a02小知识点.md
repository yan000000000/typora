# 小知识点

### 集合

the complement A\B or A-B (in other notation)
$$
A\textbackslash B = A - B
$$

### well-defined

An expression with the property that every input in the domain has exactly one output is said to be well-defined

### injective

A function f: D -> C is said to be injective(or one to one)if
$$
a \neq b \Rightarrow f(a) \neq f(b)
\\
or
\\
f(a) = f(b) \Rightarrow a = b
$$

> only one number exist for x -> y

单射函数，只能一对一

### surjectivity

A function f: D -> C is said to be surjective(or onto) if for any value y in the codomain C, there is at least one x in the domain D such that y = f(x)

满射函数，可以多对一，y中每个函数值都需要有至少一个x对应

### bijective

A function f: D -> C is said to be bijective if it is both injective and surjective

### mathematical induction

1. 

* P(1) is true
* Assumed P(n) is true for some n $\in$ $\N$ , if P(n + 1) is true

then we have P(n) is true for all n $\in$ $\N$ 

2. 

* P(1) & P(2) are true
* Assumed P(n) is true for some n $\in$ $\N$ , if P(n+2) is true

then we have P(n) is true for all n $\in$ $\N$ 

3. 

* P(1) is true
* P(1)...P(n) is true

then we have P(n+1) is true for all n $\in$ $\N$

4. forward backward
