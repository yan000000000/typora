#### Principle 4 People respond to incentives

<font color = '#e65529'>Incentive</font> 

* sth that induces a person to act
* can have unintended consequences
* 所以研究人们怎么回应incentive是很重要的

### How people interact

#### Principle 5 Trade can make everyone better off

微观角度

you can buy a greater variety of goods and services at lower cost

宏观角度

Allow countries to specialize in what they do best

enjoy a greater variety of goods and services at low price

#### Principle 6 Markets are usually a good way to organize economic activity

大多数曾经为计划经济的国家都转向市场经济

在市场经济中

* central planner are replaced by those of millions of firms and households
* firms decide whom to hire and what to make
* Households decide where to work and what to buy with their incomes

因为做决策的权力没有下放，计划经济没有积极性，相反市场就可以用一双无形的大手利用价格调动市场的积极性，使得价格和自主兴趣可以占据主导。

所以价格是市场中非常重要的因素，它影响了商品的成本和质量

Sellers look at the price when deciding how much to supply

Buyers look at the price when deciding how much to demand

当然它有时需要制定下限来保障某些群体的利益（工会等

#### Principle 7 Governments can sometimes improve market outcomes

政府的作用

* Enforce rules and institutions
* Enforce property rights(the ability to own and control over resources)

* promote efficiency（市场的调节功能更倾向efficiency
* promote equality（市场不equality，所以进行调节尽量做到equality是社会的共同认识，

* 当出现经济危机的时候调节市场
* Impact of one person's actions on the well-being of a bystander（环境污染，以次充好）
* 调节垄断

### How the economy as a whole works

#### Principle 8 A country's standard of living depends on its ability to produce goods and services

* large differences in living standards around the world
* large changes in living standards over time
* 这些区别都是生产力的不同体现的
* <font color = '#3e9e02'>但是国家生产力与国民幸福感也是不同的东西</font>

生产力

Quantity of goods and services produced from each unit of labor input

决定了生活质量

生产力的增长率决定了平均收入的增长

#### Principle 9 Prices rise when the government prints too much money

Inflation : An increase in the overall level of prices in the economy，长远来看就是单位钱的价值降低了

高通胀会带来社会问题，政府需要维持通胀在一定水平内

政府印越多钱，通胀就越厉害

#### Principle 10 Society faces a short-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment

是宏观调控的一大手段

* stimulates the overall level of spending and demand for goods and
  services
* Higher demand causes firms to raise prices, hire more workers, and
  produce a larger quantity of goods and services
*  More hiring means lower unemployment

Short-run trade-off between unemployment and inflation

* Many economic policies push unemployment and inflation in
  opposite directions
* Key role in analysis of business cycle

business cycle : fluctuations in economic activity, such as employment and production
