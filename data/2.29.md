### sentinel

circular list, like a clock

#### disadvantage

can take up more space for the extra head, especially when there is so many small list with empty element

### practice

you were asked to design a library that maintains a music playlist. The requirements are:

* Users may add or remove a song to or from the list frequently
* Users may play the list in sequential or random order

#### choose list

hard part is the random

#### choose array

hard part is the remove

usually they do to remove is having a delete flag to show if it is delete

for example it store only 1 and 0, and 0 show it is fine and 1 show it is delete

### stack

only at one end of the list is allowed to insert and delete

#### LIFO

last in first out

#### application

* **web page**(in the news web, next page is like put one at the end of the cache and prior page is like take one away from the cache)
* undo

### postfix method

#### example

5 3 6 * + 7 - = ?

whenever you meet a operator, you pop the last 2 pushed element  and calculate the result of this 2 number using the calculation and then push the result back into the stack

in this example

we push(5) -> push(3) -> push(6) --> * -->pop 3 and 6 --> get result(18) --> push(18) -> + --> pop 5 and 18 --> get 23 --> push 23 --> push 7 -> - -->get(23-7)= 16 --> push 16 --> = 16

### incremental strategy

limited array space（need to increase when it is full)
