# physics

## 1. Measurement

### SI Units

### Changing Units

### Length

### Time

### Mass

### Density

## 2. Motion along a straight line

### Position

### Displacement

the displacement of $\Delta x$ of a particle is the change in its position
$$
\Delta x = x_2 - x_1
$$

### Average Velocity

$$
V_{avg} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \frac{x_2-x_1}{t_2-t_1}
$$



### Average Speed

$$
S_{avg} = \frac{total \ distance}{\Delta t}
$$



### Instantaneous Velocity

$$
v = lim_{\Delta t\rightarrow 0}\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \frac{dx}{dt}
$$

* the instantaneous velocity could be found as the slope(gradient) in the graph of x versus t
* Speed is the magnitude of instantaneous velocity
* it has direction

### Average Acceleration

$$
a_{avg} = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}
$$



### Instantaneous Acceleration

$$
a = \frac{dv}{dt} = \frac{d^2x}{dt^2}
$$



### Constant Acceleration

$$
v = v_0 + at \\
x - x_0 = v_0t + \frac{1}{2}at^2 \\
v^2 = v_0^2 + 2a(x-x_0) \\
x - x_0 = \frac{1}{2}(v_0+v)t \\
x - x_0 = vt - \frac{1}{2}at^2
$$

* can't be used when a is not a constant in the serious of motion

### Free-Fall Acceleration

## 3. Vectors

### Scalars and Vectors

* scalars have only magnitude only
* vectors have both magnitude and direction

### Adding Vectors Geometrically

$$
\vec{a} + \vec{b} = \vec{b}+\vec{a} \\
(\vec{a}+\vec{b})+\vec{c} = \vec{a}+(\vec{b}+\vec{c})
$$

### Components of a Vector

the components of a vector are projections of the vector along the coordinate axes.
$$
a_x = a \cos\theta \\
a_y = a \sin \theta \\
a = \sqrt{a_x^2 + b_y^2} \\
\tan \theta = \frac{a_y}{a_x}
$$

### Unit-Vector Notation

$$
\vec{a} = a_x\hat{i}+a_y\hat{j}+a_z\hat{k}
$$

* unit vectors  $\hat{i}$,  $\hat{j}$,  $\hat{k}$ have magnitudes of unity and are directed in the positive directions of the x, y, z axes
