### avogadro's number

$$
N_{A} = 6.02 * 10^{23} mol^-1
$$

$$
M = mN_{A}
$$

### Ideal gases

$$
pV = nRT
$$

R is a constant n is the number of moles of the gas present

by applying $N = n \ N_{A}$ we receive another constant **k** where $k = \frac{R}{N_{A}}$ so we have
$$
pV = NkT
$$
connecting the above formula with **work** we have
$$
W = nRT \ ln^{\frac{V_{f}}{V_{i}}}
$$

$$
p =\frac{nMv^2_{avg}}{3V}
$$

Where $v_{rms} = \sqrt{(v^2)_{avg}}$ 

in terms of temperature
$$
v_{rms} = \sqrt{\frac{3RT}{M}}
$$

### 动能

$$
K_{avg} = \frac{3}{2}kT
$$

### 平均自由程

$$
\lambda = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}\pi d^2\frac{N}{V}}
$$

mean free path $\lambda$ of a gas molecule is its average path length between collisions 

 $\frac{N}{V}$ is the number of molecules per unit volume and d is the molecular diameter

### maxwell's speed distribution

### Internal Energy

$$
E_{int} = (nN_{A})K_{avg} = (nN_{A})\frac{3}{2}kT
$$

Recall that $k = \frac{R}{N_{A}}$, we have 
$$
E_{int} = \frac{3}{2}nRT
$$

### Molar Specific Heat at constant volume

$$
Q = nC_{v}\Delta T
$$

by substituting this formula into the first law of therodynamic, we have
$$
\Delta E_{int} = Q - W\\
= nC_{v}\Delta T - W
$$
Given that we are dealing with constant volume, so $W = 0$. Thus we derive the formula of molar specific heat 
$$
C_{v} = \frac{\Delta E_{int}}{n\Delta T}
$$
Recall that we have $\Delta E_{int}= \frac{3}{2}nR \Delta T$, hence
$$
C_{v} = \frac{3}{2}R = 12.5J/mol\cdot K
$$
 subtituting it back we can find
$$
E_{int} = nC_{v}T
$$
which can conclude that the internal energy only related to the temperature.

### Molar Specific Heat at constant pressure

Similar to the molar specific heat at constant volume

We first consider the $Q$ 
$$
Q = n C_{p}\Delta T
$$
We also know that when given a constant pressure, the work can be writen as $W = q\Delta V = nR\Delta T$ 
$$
\Delta E_{int} = Q - W\\
nC_{v}\Delta T = nC_{p}\Delta T - p\Delta V
$$
Divide $n\Delta T$ at both side we can derive
$$
C_{v} = C_{p} - \frac{p\Delta V}{n\Delta T}\\
C_{v} = C_{p} - \frac{nR\Delta T}{n\Delta T}\\
C_{v} = C_{p} - R
$$
We have
$$
C_{p} = C_{v}+R
$$
Which means <font color = '#e65529'>$C_{p}$ is greater than the molar specific heat at constant volume $C_{v}$</font>
